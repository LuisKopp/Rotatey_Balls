# Rotatey_Balls

Initially [Rotatey Cube](https://github.com/tobozo/Rotatey_Cube) rewritten to work with ESP32, but without the original [MPU6050 Arduino library](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/tree/master/Arduino/MPU6050).

The mpu6050 code used in this build was taken [from here](http://tocknlab.hatenablog.com/entry/2017/03/11/182703).
It'll also work on ESP8266 with only minor changes, the logic has been Tested on different builds, including the [esp8266_deauther](https://github.com/spacehuhn/esp8266_deauther/pull/584).
